## Introduction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is widely used for diabetes prediction tasks.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

pip install mlxtend
pip install pandas
pip install missingno
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:


## Data Source

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which can be found on Kaggle.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of several features and a target variable (Outcome):

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age:** Age (years)
- **Outcome:** Class variable (0 or 1)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) section, including:

- Loading the data
- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
- Calculating descriptive statistics

## Data Preprocessing

This section handles missing values (if any) and prepares the data for model training.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The notebook uses machine learning models to predict diabetes. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
4. Run the cells sequentially.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary Python libraries.
2. **Load Data:** Loads the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
3. **Data Exploration:** Explores the dataset, displaying summary statistics and initial data samples.
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Handles any required data preprocessing steps.
5. **Model Training:** Trains a machine learning model for diabetes prediction.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model using appropriate metrics.
